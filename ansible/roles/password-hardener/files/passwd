# In these lines the password modele is used.
#         In this example:
#               ---> the user is given 3 opportunities to enter a strong password
#               ---> selecting a password with a minimum length of 8 and 
#                    with at least 1 digit number, 1 upper case letter, and 1 
#                    other character is required 
#               ---> checking whether the password (with possible modifications) 
#                    contains the user name in some form. 
#               ---> the module will return error on failed check even if the user
#                    changing the password is root. This option is off by default 
#                    which means that just the message about the failed check is 
#                    printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that 
#                    root is not asked for an old password so the checks that 
#                    compare the old and new password are not performed.
